This is a test document for End-to-End testing of the NotebookLM MCP HTTP Server.

## Section 1: Introduction
The NotebookLM MCP HTTP Server provides a REST API for interacting with Google NotebookLM.

## Section 2: Features
- Asking questions about notebook content
- Adding and managing sources
- Generating audio overviews, presentations, and reports
- Creating and managing notes

## Section 3: Technical Details
The architecture consists of:
1. HTTP wrapper (Express.js)
2. Session manager (Playwright browser sessions)
3. Content manager (source and content operations)

This document should provide enough content for testing.
