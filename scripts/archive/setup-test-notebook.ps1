This is a test document for End-to-End testing of the NotebookLM MCP HTTP Server.

## Section 1: Introduction
The NotebookLM MCP HTTP Server provides a REST API for interacting with Google's NotebookLM.
It supports features like:
- Asking questions about notebook content
- Adding and managing sources
- Generating audio overviews, presentations, and reports
- Creating and managing notes

## Section 2: Test Data
Here are some test facts for verification:
- The project is written in TypeScript
- It uses Playwright for browser automation
- The server runs on port 3000 by default
- Multiple Google accounts can be used for rate limit rotation

## Section 3: Technical Details
The architecture consists of:
1. HTTP wrapper (Express.js)
2. Session manager (Playwright browser sessions)
3. Content manager (source and content operations)
4. Account manager (multi-account support)

This document should provide enough content for testing various NotebookLM features.
